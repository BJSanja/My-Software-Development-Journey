# My-Software-Development-Journey

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "Software Development".

I want to become a successful DevOps engineer.

Frist I  plan to develop Software engineering Foundation knowledge & skills.
In this path will help me to develop skill sets in a variety of technologies
 with the tools that successful software developers use to build, deploy, test, run, and manage Full Stack applications, and I get the practical skills to      begin a new career. 

To achieve this goal I follow two courses,
